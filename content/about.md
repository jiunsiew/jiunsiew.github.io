### The main reason for this blog
I forget easily.  

This is a repository about my discoveries in all things related to data analytics, and the 
so called science behind it.

Writing about it will hopefully help me remember something.  
At the very least, I'll have a copy of it online.

### The main reason for this page

An engineer by training with a signal processing background, I have been doing 
mathematical and statistical modelling work in lots of different sectors like 
wireless communications, financial risk management in energy markets, energy forecasting 
and website companies.  I currently work with a highly talented data science team at 
[Hitwise](http://connexity.com/hitwise/) and have the privilege of saying that I really 
love my job.

I've used Matlab, Python, and C before but R stole my heart after I learnt I didn't have 
to pay, got my head around the idea of a data-frame and discovered *RStudio*, *plyr* and 
*ggplot2* :).

I also have the privilege of helping run the Melbourne R Users Meetup Group, also known 
as [MelbURN](http://www.meetup.com/MelbURN-Melbourne-Users-of-R-Network/).

### The main reason you might want to read this blog

In the open source spirit that underpins R, hopefully some of the things I've captured 
here will be relevant to some work you might be doing somewhere out there.  

Hopefully, if it is useful you can let me know.  

Hopefully, if it isn't useful you can let me know in a nice way so I can learn something 
from you too.
