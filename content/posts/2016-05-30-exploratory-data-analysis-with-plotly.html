<p>I recently had the honour of presenting at the Melbourne User of R Network (MelbURN) where I presented on the R package <code>plotly</code>.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I compared doing some exploratory data analysis with <a href="https://plot.ly">Plotly</a> using the performance data of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (which is publically available <a href="https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory">here</a>).</p>
<p>The presentation can be found here and is best viewed with Chrome or Safari: <a href="http://jiunsiew.github.io/plotly_presentation/" class="uri">http://jiunsiew.github.io/plotly_presentation/</a></p>
<p>The main point of the talk is really that Plotly plots can be really powerful, primarily because of its interactivity capabilities.</p>
<p>One of my own learnings from using Plotly is that interactive capabilities requires a bit of rethink around how to actually visualise data.</p>
<p>A good example is that with interactivity it’s quite possible to plot a number of time series’ on one plot and simply toggle the series on and off rather than doing a facet plot, as is common to do with ggplot (see <a href="http://jiunsiew.github.io/plotly_presentation/#18">slide 18</a>).</p>
<p>It was also my second foray into using the <a href="http://slidify.org">slidify</a> package.<br />
Have to say I was pretty impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2016-06-06)</strong></p>
<p>I was also very graciously asked to present this to the Melbourne Python Users Group.</p>
