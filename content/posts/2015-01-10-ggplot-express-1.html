<p>Here are some code snippets with ggplot that I use very often but forget equally as much.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># to set the theme so you don&#39;t have to keep typing &quot;+ theme_bw()&quot;
theme_set(theme_bw())

# to rotate the x-axis labels
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# to put the legend at the bottom/top/wherever
theme(legend.position = &#39;bottom&#39;)  # or wherever you want--see the help

# to stack the legend icons and position the legend title
guides(col = guide_legend(ncol = 7, title.position = &#39;top&#39;))</code></pre>
