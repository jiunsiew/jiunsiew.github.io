<p>Came across this website today called <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/">Global Forest Watch</a>. It’s got some really great mapping visuals. Having dabbled in a bit of mapping in R, the graphics that this site has is really, really amazing.</p>
<p>I tried simple <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/5/-0.73/114.10/ALL/grayscale/loss,forestgain?geojson=%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522Polygon%2522%252C%2522coordinates%2522%253A%255B%255B%255B92.0215%252C9.0587%255D%252C%255B119.4434%252C8.0157%255D%252C%255B120.2783%252C3.5134%255D%252C%255B129.3311%252C3.5134%255D%252C%255B128.9795%252C-11.1784%255D%252C%255B109.1162%252C-11.7813%255D%252C%255B96.2402%252C-3.645%255D%252C%255B92.0215%252C9.0587%255D%255D%255D%257D&amp;begin=2001-01-01&amp;end=2012-12-01&amp;threshold=10#embed">zooming in on Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore</a> and was quite surprised to see a fair bit of tree cover gain, about 9.7 million hectares to be exact. Sadly, the amount of loss was almost twice that at about 18.5 million hectares (unfortunately, wordpress.com doesn’t allow embedding so I’ve added a screenshot below).</p>

<p>Another area of interest for me was in <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/7/-42.07/146.32/ALL/grayscale/loss,forestgain?geojson=%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522Polygon%2522%252C%2522coordinates%2522%253A%255B%255B%255B143.9209%252C-40.38%255D%252C%255B149.6777%252C-40.3465%255D%252C%255B147.9199%252C-44.2767%255D%252C%255B145.3711%252C-43.8662%255D%252C%255B143.9209%252C-40.38%255D%255D%255D%257D&amp;begin=2001-01-01&amp;end=2012-12-01&amp;threshold=10#embed">Tasmania</a>, where I found a lot of the logging was in the northern part of the island.</p>

<p>What was interesting here was that comparatively, the amount of loss compared to the amount of gain was only about 28,500 hectares. A lot of the losses which haven’t had recovery seems to have come in the western part of the state where there’s quite a bit of mining activity.</p>
