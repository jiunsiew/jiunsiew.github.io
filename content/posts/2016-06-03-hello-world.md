### A new blog...again

Given that most of my posts are now quite programming centric, I've decided to move away
from the world of CMS (Wordpress) and into the a slightly more streamlined approached of 
using markdown files with R, RStudio and R Markdown.  

### Why move?

- I recently discovered a number of R bloggers using websites powered by Jekyll
and [Github.com](www.github.com) and am hoping that the workflow will be better.  This 
template that I'm using was *relatively* simple to get working and it doesn't look like...Netscape.

- The idea of working with files that are version controlled on Github is really appealing.

- Using markdown, and in particular R Markdown means I can go right from code to figures, 
bypassing a lot of the manual exports.

- It's free and I no longer have any ads on my site!

### To infinity and beyond!
So, hopefully this means I'll actually be adding more posts in the near future and hopefully 
this workflow will allow me to focus more on the analytics.
