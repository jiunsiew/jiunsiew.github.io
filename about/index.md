### The main reason for this blog
I forget easily.  

This is a repository about my discoveries in all things related to data analytics, and the 
so called science behind it.

Writing about it will hopefully help me remember something.  
At the very least, I'll have a copy of it online.

### The main reason for this page

An engineer by training with a signal processing background, I have been doing 
mathematical and statistical modelling work in sectors like wireless communications, 
consulting, energy and website companies.  I've used Matlab, Python, C but really love 
using R after I got my head around the idea of a data-frame :).

### The main reason you might want to read this blog

In the open source spirit that underpins R, hopefully some of the things I've captured 
here will be relevant to some work you might be doing somewhere out there.  

Hopefully, if it is useful you can let me know.  

Hopefully, if it isn't useful you can let me know in a nice way so I can learn something 
from you too.
