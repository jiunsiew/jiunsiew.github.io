      <description>FlashbackThis is the second post in a series on analysing rooftop PV solar using R. In the first post, I spilt a lot of digital ink on how to setup the project. A slow start perhaps, but in this post, we’ll look at something more directly R related.
In particular, I’ll cover how to get data from Excel into R, and tidy it up into a format that makes things easier to analyse later.</description>

      <description>Doing data analysis is quite often much more than just doing fancy algorithms and visualisations. There’s typically a lot of background data minging (no that’s not a typo) work that needs to be done, particularly if you’re intending to sustain your code over a period of time and share it with others. I thought I’d write a bit about this whole workflow by doing a series of post analysing the amount of residential rooftop solar PV in Australia.</description>
