      <description>IntroductionOn a recent whim, I decided to upgrade to the latest version of dplyr to version 0.7.0 without doing much prior reading into the changes that were made. As a result, I very quickly discovered the database connections that were once in-built had been abstracted to another package called dbplyr, resulting in some strange errors. “No worries”, I thought as I then just installed that package.
Re-running some code that connected to a local Postgres database provided some very frustrating errors.</description>
