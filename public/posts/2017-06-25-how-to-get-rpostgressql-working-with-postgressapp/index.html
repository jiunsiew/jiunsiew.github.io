<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On a recent whim, I decided to upgrade to the latest version of <code>dplyr</code> to version 0.7.0 without doing much prior reading into the changes that were made. As a result, I very quickly discovered the database connections that were once in-built had been abstracted to another package called <code>dbplyr</code>, resulting in some strange errors. “No worries”, I thought as I then just installed that package.</p>
<p>Re-running some code that connected to a local Postgres database provided some very frustrating errors. “No worries”, I thought to myself again, and proceeded to then upgrade my version of R to version 3.4.0, only to be met with the same frustrating errors of not being able to connect to my database due to some errors with the <code>RPostgresSQL</code> package.</p>
<p>I was eventually able to get everything back up and running but only after having to dig into the source code of <code>RPostgresSQL</code> and recompiling it. The steps I had to go through are outlined below.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this excercise (or ordeal, if you will), it dawned on me that this was a really good example of the benefits and drawbacks of open source software and thought I’d opine a bit on this issue.</p>
<p>But first, the technical bits…</p>

<h2>When all else fails, look at the source</h2>
<p>If you happen to use macOS and want to use Postgres, you’ll very quickly find that <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> is a very handy way to get started. It worked pretty much out-of-the-box with previous versions of <code>RPostgresSQL</code> and <code>dplyr</code>. I have no idea what changed but with <code>dplyr</code> version 0.7.0 and the abstraction of the database connections to <code>dbplyr</code>, the out-of-the-box functionality broke with <code>RPostgresSQL</code>.</p>
<div id="whats-gone-wrong" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s gone wrong?</h3>
<p>Basically, <code>RPostgresSQL</code> was unable to find the Postgres executable files. By default, <code>RPostgresSQL</code> will search for the Postgres applications in <code>/usr/lib</code> or <code>/opt/lib</code> directories. The problem is that by default, <code>Postgres.app</code> is installed in the <code>/Applications</code> directory which is not in the search path of <code>RPostgresSQL</code>. The diagnosis of this problem was probably the hardest and most frustrating part but one clue did come from this <a href="https://iangow.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/installing-rpostgresql-with-r-2-13-on-a-mac/">blog post by Ian Gow</a>.</p>

<div id="so-how-do-you-fix-it" class="section level3">
<h3>So, how do you fix it?</h3>
<p>Well, <em>a</em> solution is to modify the source code, making sure that the path is added appropriately, and recompile the package. This is actually not as hard as it sounds and I was able to get everything working as before. Here are the steps I took to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, download the source code from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html">CRAN</a>. You’ll want to download the <code>*.tar.gz</code> source code file. Save it to a local directory. I saved it to the default <code>~/Downloads</code> directory on my home drive.</li>
<li>Then, fire up the Terminal and uncompress the file with the command: <code>tar xvzf RPostgreSQL_0.4-1.tar.gz</code> (I got version 0.4.1 which seems to have already been updated to v0.6.2 as of 2017-06-24).</li>
<li>You now need to open up the <code>configure</code> file in the uncompressed directory.</li>
<li>Look for the following bits of code:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="bash"><code>for dir in \
    /usr/include \
    /usr/include/pgsql \
    /usr/include/postgresql \
    /usr/local/include \ ...</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Once you’ve found that (it was around line 2915 of the code version I got), add the location of the <code>Postgres.app</code> to the end of the list. I found two such loops and added the new location to both.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="bash"><code>for dir in \
    /usr/include \
    /usr/include/pgsql \
    /usr/include/postgresql \
    /usr/local/include \
    ...
    /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/include
    do 
 ...</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Finally, re-install the R package with the newly modified file using the command:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;~/Downloads/RPostgreSQL&quot;, repos=NULL, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Problem solved.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the changes above were enough for me to get database connections working again. However, the comments to Ian Gow’s blog post above does provide a link to the <code>RPostgresSQL</code> <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/rpostgresql/issues/30">issue tracker</a> where there is another suggested fix which involves</p>
<blockquote>
<p>defin[ing] the full path for pg_config in the environment variable $PG_CONFIG…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t try this as I was happy enough with the solution I got. Hope that helps…someone.</p>
