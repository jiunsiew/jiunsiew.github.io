## A new blog...again
Given that most of my posts are now quite programming centric, I've decided to move away
from the world of CMS (Wordpress) and into the a slightly more streamlined approached of 
using markdown files with R, RStudio and R Markdown.  

I recently discovered a number of R bloggers using websites powered by Jekyll
and [Github.com](www.github.com) and am hoping that the workflow will be better.  

In the coming weeks I will endeavour to port over all posts from 
my [wordpress site](www.jiunsiew.wordpress.com) onto this one.
