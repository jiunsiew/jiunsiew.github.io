This past weekend, there was a pretty interesting article in the [Financial Times](https://next.ft.com/content/2e43b3e8-01c7-11e6-ac98-3c15a1aa2e62) on the 
somewhat *liberal* use of statistics by politicians.

Here are some highlights that I thought were worth capturing:

> Frankfurt concluded that the difference between the liar and the bullshitter 
was that the liar cared about the truth — cared so much that he wanted to 
obscure it — while the bullshitter did not. The bullshitter, said Frankfurt, 
was indifferent to whether the statements he uttered were true or not. 
“He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.”
>
> Statistical bullshit is a special case of bullshit in general, and it appears to 
be on the rise. This is partly because social media — a natural vector for 
statements made purely for effect — are also on the rise. On Instagram and 
Twitter we like to share attention-grabbing graphics, surprising headlines and 
figures that resonate with how we already see the world. Unfortunately, very few 
claims are eye-catching, surprising or emotionally resonant because they are 
true and fair. Statistical bullshit spreads easily these days; all it takes 
is a click.


The reference to Frankfurt here is Harry Frankfurt who wrote an essay wonderfully 
titled "On Bullshit" (how could you go wrong with that?).

The article also goes on to talk about how statistics can be used to tell 
stories effectively and uses Florence Nightingale as an example--a very good 
illustration of how a good visualisation can get a nuanced story across.  
Her use of a Rose diagram [(see this link referenced in the FT article)](http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/?p=462) 
was particularly brilliant.

> ...in 1857, she crafted what has become known as the Rose Diagram, a beautiful 
array of coloured wedges showing the deaths from infectious diseases before and 
after the sanitary improvements at Scutari.
> 
> The Rose Diagram isn’t a dry presentation of statistical truth. It tells a 
story. Its structure divides the death toll into two periods — before the 
sanitary improvements, and after. In doing so, it highlights a sharp break that 
is less than clear in the raw data. And the Rose Diagram also gently obscures 
other possible interpretations of the numbers — that, for example, the death 
toll dropped not because of improved hygiene but because winter was over. The 
Rose Diagram is a marketing pitch for an idea. The idea was true and vital, and 
Nightingale’s campaign was successful. One of her biographers, Hugh Small, 
argues that the Rose Diagram ushered in health improvements that raised life 
expectancy in the UK by 20 years and saved millions of lives.
> 
> What makes Nightingale’s story so striking is that she was able to see that 
statistics could be tools and weapons at the same time. She educated herself 
using the data, before giving it the makeover it required to convince others. 
Though the Rose Diagram is a long way from “the dryest of all reading”, it is 
also a long way from bullshit. Florence Nightingale realised that the truth 
about public health was so vital that it could not simply be recited in a 
monotone. It needed to sing.

The storytelling component of the article really resonated with me as I quite 
often find that effective communication is overlooked and understated by many in 
this industry.   

More Rose diagrams, less powerpoint.  

If only.
